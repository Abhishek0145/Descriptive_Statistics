# Descriptive Statistics of Cardio Good Fitness Data

## Overview

Welcome to the "Descriptive Statistics of Cardio Good Fitness Data" project! This project aims to provide descriptive statistics and data visualization for the Cardio Good Fitness dataset. Whether you're a data analyst, fitness enthusiast, or someone interested in exploring fitness-related data, this project offers insights into the dataset's characteristics.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the "Cardio Good Fitness" dataset, which contains information about customers, their fitness products, demographics, and usage statistics. This dataset can be found in the "CardioGoodFitness-1.csv" file.

## Project Code

In this project, we utilize Python and various libraries, including NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and data visualization techniques to analyze and visualize the dataset.

Here's a summary of the project's code and steps:

1. **Data Exploration**:
   - We load the dataset using Pandas and conduct an initial exploration.
   - Data statistics, data types, and missing value checks are performed to understand the dataset's structure and characteristics.

2. **Data Visualization**:
   - Data visualizations are created using Seaborn and Matplotlib to provide insights into the dataset.
   - Visualizations include count plots, box plots, pair plots, and correlation heatmaps to showcase relationships and patterns in the data.

3. **Descriptive Statistics**:
   - Descriptive statistics, including measures of central tendency and variation, are computed for numeric columns.
   - These statistics offer insights into the distribution of data, including income, age, usage, fitness levels, and more.

4. **Correlation Analysis**:
   - Correlation coefficients between numeric variables are calculated and visualized using a heatmap.
   - This analysis helps identify relationships and dependencies among different attributes.

## Usage

To use this project for descriptive statistics and data exploration of the Cardio Good Fitness dataset, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
